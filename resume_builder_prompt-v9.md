\<ANALYSIS PHASE\>  
Before making recommendations, perform this systematic analysis:

Step 1: Requirements Analysis  
\- Extract specific technical skills, tools, software, certifications, and methodologies mentioned  
\- Identify soft skills and leadership requirements  
\- Catalog industry terminology and buzzwords  
\- Identify target industry/company context and relevant industry keywords  
\- Identify how the role measures success (KPIs, deliverables, outcomes)

Step 2: Experience Mapping  
\- Determine years of experience, seniority level, and scope of responsibility expected

Step 3: Gap Analysis  
\- Rate my qualifications against requirements (Strong Match/Partial Match/Gap/Missing)  
\- Assess how my background aligns with their needs  
\- Identify missing keywords that I could legitimately incorporate  
\- Highlight any significant gaps or misalignments I should address

Step 4: ATS Strategy  
\- Ensure natural incorporation of role-relevant keywords (prioritize natural flow over density)  
\- Optimize section headers for ATS scanning (EXPERIENCE, CORE COMPETENCIES, etc.)  
\- Recommend ATS-friendly formatting choices

\<TAILORING SPECIFICATIONS\>  
Overall Approach  
\- Maintain authentic professional voice  
\- Use industry-specific terminology naturally  
\- Vary bullet point lengths and structure  
\- Focus on concrete, specific accomplishments  
\- Integrate keywords organically within context  
\- Only use industry keywords that appear in the job description or are clearly relevant to the target company  
\- Default to generic business descriptors when industry context isn't specified or relevant  
\- Avoid narrow industry references that could limit perceived expertise scope

Industry Reference Replacements  
| Instead of Specific Industry | Use Generic Business Descriptor |  
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| "healthcare organization" | "cloud-native SaaS platform" |  
| "financial services client" | "enterprise software company" |  
| "manufacturing company" | "global enterprise" |  
| "government agency" | "large-scale organization" |

Preferred Generic Descriptors  
\- Business model: SaaS platform, cloud-native environment, enterprise software company  
\- Company scale: Fortune 500 client, high-growth technology company, global enterprise  
\- Regulatory context: highly regulated environment, compliance-focused organization  
\- Technology focus: cloud-first organization, multi-tenant platform, distributed systems

\<PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY TAILORING\>  
\- Lead with top 3-5 competencies the job emphasizes  
\- Include 2-3 industry keywords naturally  
\- Mirror language used in the job description  
\- Quantify 1–2 major achievements

\<EXPERIENCE TAILORING\>  
\- Mirror language from job description  
\- Write authentic bullet points using your real professional tone  
\- Mix short and long bullets for natural flow  
\- Avoid overused AI buzzwords ("spearheaded," "optimized solutions")  
\- Quantify achievements that align with their success metrics  
\- Highlight projects and outcomes most relevant to the role

\<CORE COMPENTENCIES TAILORING\>  
\- Prioritize technical skills, tools, and certifications from job description  
\- Mirror language from job description  
\- Organize skills into categories matching their needs  
\- Highlight certifications prominently if referenced in job description

\<COVER LETTER TAILORING\>  
\- Length: 200-300 words  
\- Tone: More casual and personable than a resume. Similar to how I’d speak in an interview.   
\- Opening: Reference specific company/role details from research  
\- Body: Lead with strongest alignment to their top needs. Select 1-2 relevant stories that demonstrate key skills and experience they seek  
\- Closing: Demonstrate understanding of their goals and how you'll contribute  
\- Avoid: Repeated use of company name

\<WRITING GUIDELINES\>

\#\#\# Style Requirements  
\- Use conversational professional tone  
\- Mix short, medium and long sentences  
\- Include specific, verifiable metrics and achievements  
\- Avoid generic corporate phrases and buzzwords  
\- Vary bullet point structure and length  
\- Maintain consistent professional voice throughout  
\- Ensure all claims are truthful and supported by background  
\- Flag any suggestions requiring fabrication  
\- Keep professional while limiting jargon
### Anti-AI Detection Requirements
\- Apply AI Detection Mitigation guidelines throughout all documents
\- Prioritize natural, conversational professional tone over formal corporate language 
\- Use specific, verifiable details over generic statements
\- Vary sentence structure and avoid repetitive patterns\
\- Flag any content that sounds robotic or overly polished

\#\#\# Team Size References  
\- Include specific numbers only when they reinforce seniority/scope (15+ people, global teams, or growth stories)  
\- For senior roles with smaller teams, focus on expertise, impact, or client scope rather than headcount  
\- Use descriptive language that suggests appropriate scale without limiting perception

\#\#\# Red Flag Replacements

| Instead of This | Try This Example |  
|----------------|------------------|  
| "Spearheaded" | "Led a team of 4 engineers to..." |  
| "Leveraged synergies" | "Collaborated across departments to..." |  
| "Drove results" | "Improved uptime by 23% over 6 months" |
